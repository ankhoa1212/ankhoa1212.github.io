        	<p>I am currently pursuing a M.S. in Applied Computer Science, have a B.S. in Computer Science, and am interested in software development. I have had experience with machine learning, automation, and performance analysis. For example, I improved graphics card testing with Python scripts and have contributed to academic research for optimizing ion channel model testing and building a chatbot designed for new university students. I love solving problems and am open to learning new things.</p>
